  <h4 style="color:lightblue; text-align:center; font-family:verdana;font-size:150%;">I am 15 years old and I live in Dix Hills, New York. I enjoy playing video games with my friends on my freetime. My dream job would be working as a programmer for a succesful game developer such as Bungie or Treyarch. I hope to complete every elective and AP class that has to do with computer programming by the end of high school. Eventually my goal is to be able to program or help program a video game using the skills I have in programming and that I will learn in highschool and college. I have learned java and c++ as well as html thanks to this class and I hope I can learn more from this class.</h4>
